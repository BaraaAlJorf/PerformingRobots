# Robot Expressions and movements
Firstly, I want to make my robot perform three different sets of expressive movements.
1. The shuffle: I want my robot to move its wheels one by one from side to side- giving the illusion of a shuffle or a dance
2. The 360: I want my robot to spin around in circles by making the wheels turn in opposite directions
3. Classic forward motion: I want my robot to move forward - nothing complicated- just a simple forward movement by making its wheels move the same direction to the front.

Since I have been using the OLED as a mouth, I figured it would also make sense to animate facial expressions on my robot. My plan is to animate three different emotions/expressiosn : Joy, Sadness, and a "wave"
The "wave" is an expression that I want my robot to show while it is dancing.

The "wave" will be formed by alternating between these two images to give the illusion of a moving wave: ![Alt Text](https://github.com/BaraaAlJorf/PerformingRobots/blob/master/November2/IMG_0384.PNG) ![Alt Text](https://github.com/BaraaAlJorf/PerformingRobots/blob/master/November2/IMG_0383.PNG)
</br>

The joy animation will comprise these three expressions: ![Alt Text](https://github.com/BaraaAlJorf/PerformingRobots/blob/master/November2/IMG_0385.PNG) ![Alt Text](https://github.com/BaraaAlJorf/PerformingRobots/blob/master/November2/IMG_0382.PNG) ![Alt Text](https://github.com/BaraaAlJorf/PerformingRobots/blob/master/November2/IMG_0386.PNG)
