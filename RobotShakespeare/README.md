# Scene
I chose to re-enact the Balconey Scene from Romeo and Juliet, since it has two characters (which I could replace with my cat and mouse). I plan to make the mouse robot do minor movements as the audio of the scene is playing.
# Props
I will be Including a few props to make the cat and mouse look closer to Romeo and Juliet. I made the cat wear a red veil and painted make up on its face. I added a hat and a neck piece to the mouse.
I also made a small castle window/ Balconey for Juliet to stand behind
