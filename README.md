**Description**: I created an arduino-based circuit with 2 switches and 3 LEDs. Pressing the top switch makes the 3 LEDs light up in an alternating pattern for 5 times(loops.) The middle LED is on when the others are off and vice versa. Pressing the bottom switch makes the LEDs turn on and off consecutively starting from the one at the top until the one at the bottom, and then from the bottom to the top.
