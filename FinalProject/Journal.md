# Song Choice:
For my song, I have 3 different songs in mind, each corresponding to a different performance
</br>
Song 1: Sad Machine (by Porter Robinson)
</br>
Song 2: Evermore (from beauty and the beast)
</br>
Song 3: Tale as old as time (from beauty and the beast)

# Robot's role:
Song 1: If I end up choosing song 1, my robot will play the main singer's role who finds himself deserted on a lonely planet after a disaster has taken place- the robot will find someone else and start feeling attached to that other person (a prop shaped to look like a human)
</br>
Song 2: If I end up choosing song 2, my robot will play the role of the beast after Belle(possible a clay figure) escaped from his castle. The robot will display sadness over his lost love
</br>
Song 3: If I end up choosing song 3, my robot will also represent the beast, but this time he will be dancing happily with Belle (possible a clay figure)

# Robot Construction:
## Actors/ Props:
My plan is to have my robot look as technical and robotic as possible, might even have some wires dangling just to emphasize that he is a machine. On the far opposite end of the spectrum, I want the lover in song 1 and Belle in songs 2 and 3 to look as human as possible. The idea here is to tell a tale of a forbidden love. Much like Belle's love of the beast in the original story, Belle here falls in love with a machine.
## Costuming: 
I will probably depend on acrylic paint to add costumes to the robot, for the prop however I am hoping I would find some loose fabric that I can turn into a dress.
## Staging:
Possibly including green screen in song 1 to add image of destroyed planet, might use green screen to add night sky in song 2 and 3. For song 2 and 3, I am planning to recreate the Beast's Castle as a stage.
## Special Actions:
The OLED screen will be matched to the lyrics
</br>
If I do choose option 3, I will hopefully have the robot waltzing with Belle

# Journal Update December 6
I ended up choosing a mix between options 2 and 3
## Actors/ Props:
### The Beast:
I had a lot of trouble deciding on how to color my beast robot. I was trying to make him look similar to the beast but still as robotic as possible. After much experimentation with different shades I decided to use construction paper to give him a tuxedo (similar to the beast's) and decided to make his face white with metallic golden streaks where I found suitable.

I had the circuit placed in him using super glue in order to keep everything as stable as possible
### Belle:
To make Belle, I first used a cardboard roll as her base. I then added aluminum foil for her top. I covered her head with clay and painted a face on it. I then cut up face masks to make them look like a dress for her to dance in. In the end the final product looked like this

## The Scenery:
I had two backgrounds in which the actors performed. The first half was on top of the beast's tower where I used fake candles and a paper door to establish the castle scenery. The second part was in a wide courtroom where they could dance so I used more fake candles and used a couch to make a wall that fit into the scenery.

## The Performance:
I first played song option 2 and had the beast's OLED show a singing sad mouth that was in sync (as much as possible) with the background song. I had the robot move around sadly and aimlessly as I played around with the lighting. Occasionally, Belle would show up as part of a flashback to the Beast's past. Belle then shows up at the castle around the end of song 2 and the pair have a short conversation before they move on to the next scene where they start dancing together. The dance was based on the Waltz and I had them attached together by gluing them both to a cardboard board and had them smoothly dance around by attaching water bottle caps to their bottoms. The dance goes around for a while song 3 plays in the background.
