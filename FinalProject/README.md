# Final Project: Beauty and The Beast
The aim of this project was to utilize my knowledge using Sparkfun's I2C arduino boards to create social robots that performed theatrically. For my final project I decided to play around with the idea of a forbidden love and decided to recreate "Beauty and The Beast." The planning and process of creation can all be found under my journal file.

I ended up choosing a mix between options 2 and 3
## Actors/ Props:
### The Beast:
I had a lot of trouble deciding on how to color my beast robot. I was trying to make him look similar to the beast but still as robotic as possible. After much experimentation with different shades I decided to use construction paper to give him a tuxedo (similar to the beast's) and decided to make his face white with metallic golden streaks where I found suitable.

I had the circuit placed in him using super glue in order to keep everything as stable as possible
### Belle:
To make Belle, I first used a cardboard roll as her base. I then added aluminum foil for her top. I covered her head with clay and painted a face on it. I then cut up face masks to make them look like a dress for her to dance in. In the end the final product looked like this

## The Scenery:
I had two backgrounds in which the actors performed. The first half was on top of the beast's tower where I used fake candles and a paper door to establish the castle scenery. The second part was in a wide courtroom where they could dance so I used more fake candles and used a couch to make a wall that fit into the scenery.

## The Performance:
I first played song option 2 and had the beast's OLED show a singing sad mouth that was in sync (as much as possible) with the background song. I had the robot move around sadly and aimlessly as I played around with the lighting. Occasionally, Belle would show up as part of a flashback to the Beast's past. Belle then shows up at the castle around the end of song 2 and the pair have a short conversation before they move on to the next scene where they start dancing together. The dance was based on the Waltz and I had them attached together by gluing them both to a cardboard board and had them smoothly dance around by attaching water bottle caps to their bottoms. The dance goes around for a while song 3 plays in the background.

## Challenges:
The most challenging bit was trying to keep the beast's singing mouth in sync with the music. My main solution was to hardcode delay functions into the program.
