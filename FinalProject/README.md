# Final Project: Beauty and The Beast
The aim of this project was to utilize my knowledge using Sparkfun's I2C arduino boards to create social robots that performed theatrically. For my final project I decided to play around with the idea of a forbidden love and decided to recreate "Beauty and The Beast." The final video can be viewed by checking the link below.
