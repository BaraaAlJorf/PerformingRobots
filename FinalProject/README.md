# Final Project: Beauty and The Beast
The aim of this project was to utilize my knowledge using Sparkfun's I2C arduino boards to create social robots that performed theatrically. For my final project I decided to play around with the idea of a forbidden love and decided to recreate "Beauty and The Beast." The planning and process of creation can all be found under my journal file. The final video can be viewed by checking the link below.
