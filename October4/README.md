## Project Description:
</br>
My aim in this project was to create a robot that moves and makes sound once a button is pressed. I wanted to give the robot a little bit of a personality so I painted it and had it make high-pitched robot noises. I also added bear ears and random patches in order to make it more lively.

</br>
Initially, I wanted to figure out how to attach the circuit. To do so, I first hot-glued the motors and wheels to a piece of cardboard, and then started building up my circuit from then
</br>
by this point, I was done with the structure, but I wanted to add my personal touches so I grabbed my acrylic markers and poska pens and started painting it
</br>
Here you could find a video of the robot when the button is pressed:

## Challenges:
The main challenge I faced was to keep the robot structuraly intact. Thankfully, the glue gun was able to fix most structural problems. Additionally, my choice to give the robot a parallellogram shaped body helped prevent it from flopping over
